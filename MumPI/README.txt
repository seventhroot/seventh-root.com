MumPI is your Webinterface written in PHP for your Mumble Server ("Murmur") using the Ice-Middleware.


For installation notices, see INSTALL.txt or better yet https://github.com/Kissaki/MumPI/wiki/Installation

To access the admin area, add /admin/ to your url.
To access the viewer, add /viewer/ to your url.
To access the user, add /user/ to your url. (redirect in place)

On first admin-login your admin account will be created. No need to manually create your first admin account yourself. Just login and admin-away!


Note on accounts:
The interface is using a local database for storing mumpi admin accounts etc.
This has nothing to do with mumble or murmur accounts, but only the interface itself.
At this moment, filesystem and individual files are totally sufficient and probably better in performance than a DBS like MySQL would be (just disk I/O rather than tcp connections and a separate system to call).

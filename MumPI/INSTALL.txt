See the guide on the web: https://github.com/Kissaki/MumPI/wiki/Installation
or continue:

Note: With the installer you should be guided through most of this. However, if you encounter problems, this may still help you fix your problems.

make sure the following folders are writable:
* MumPI
* MumPI/tmp
* MumPI/data
(if you renamed MumPI, that one of course)

MAKE SURE ppl can not access the data folder or files in it from the web.
A .htaccess file is included, but depending on your webserver configuration,
it will not be read/used or you may want to specify it in your web servers virtual host configuration.


Check the settings.inc.php the installer creates to set up MumPI.

If you don't use the default Ice IP + port (localhost), you will have to specify it in the settings file.
Otherwise, the interface should work out of the box.

For registration to work with captchas, you will need the gd php extension loaded.
If you don't want to use the included captcha (spam protection), check the settings file.

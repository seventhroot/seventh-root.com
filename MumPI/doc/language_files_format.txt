Language files have to immediately begin with "<?php" and end with "?>".
The code will be eval()'d to get the $txt array.

More specific language files (like for a specific section or page) may overwrite the strings of the more general language files.

Structure:
-languages/
 -<lang>/
  -main.lang.php
  -<section>.lang.php
  -<section>/
   -<page>.lang.php



This will very likely be changed to be theme based (so themes can have their own strings, but don't have to):
-themes/
 -<theme>/
  -languages/
   -<lang>/
    -main.lang.php
    -<section>.lang.php
    -<section>/
     -<page>.lang.php
 -default/
  -languages/
   -<lang>/
    -main.lang.php
    -<section>.lang.php
    -<section>/
     -<page>.lang.php

Then, language files will not only be parsed hierarchical (main, section and page) but also active theme or default theme.
